	Loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great.
	To take a trivial example, which of us ever laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
	But who find fault chooses to enjoy a pleasure one avoids a pain produces no.
	Blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil.

	But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.
	To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
	No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
	Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
