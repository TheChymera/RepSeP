% To use PDF output directly from dot
% dot -Tpdf

% Modified by Remi Dubot (remi.dubot@irit.fr)

% To distinguish errors from tex and from dot. 
% Report dot errors
% Indications for non english writers

% add the following lines to your preamble:

% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% \usepackage{graphviz}

% parameters to \digraph:
% 1 - parameters for \includegraphics (optional; default value is "scale=1")
% 2 - name of the digraph
% 3 - body of the digraph

% parameters to \includedot
% 1 - parameters for \includegraphics (optional; default value is "scale=1")
% 2 - name of the dot file (w/out file extension, which must be `.dot')

% ASSUMES pdflatex 
% If you are not using pdflatex, go back on an older version of this style. 

% If you are not writing english, pay attention to your charset. 
% If is not UTF-8, you may have to indicate your charset to dot with "-Gccharset=XXXX".
