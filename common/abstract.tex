As the scientific world becomes increasingly large and increasingly reliant on automation, reproducibility becomes more and more vital for the successful development of both the scientific community and research technologies.
For most researchers, however, reproducibility remains a nebulous ideal, the benefits of which are considered more theoretical and indirect, than practical and immediate.
In this article we share a reference implementation of an article, which makes the benefits of reproducibility accessible and reusable.
In this article we put forth an explicit reproducibility model, which is both simple and consistently applicable throughout the scientific process, and thus to the work of any scientist.
We proceed to select a set of technologies which strongly facilitate reproducibility, and present to the reader a plethora of reproductions of peer-reviewed scientific work.
While this framework is as all encompassing as possible, we see it thus as an excelent reference implementation which which is reusable across a wide range of topics.
